# Welcome to My Analysis on INNOVA ELECTRONIC SALE DATA. 

***

### Task

    I am to analyse the monthly sale data of the past year of Innova Electronic in orther to identify the sales trends,mostpopular 
    products and sale pics. These informations are going to be used to take strategic commertial descisions. I have been provided 
    with sale data in a csv format which i'm going to use for the analysis and make some visualisation to help take descisions.


### Description
    
    I had to load the data provided in a pandas Dataframe so i could easily manipulate it. I explored the dataset to see how the
    data in looks like and if there were missing values, shape of my dataframe to know the dimensions and the informations on
    my dataframe to know the type of data i'm going to manipulate. I further made some calculations to see the the revenue in
    each month and also displayed the top 5 most polular product in terms of quantity sold for each month. I made some
    visualisation to see clearly how the sale trends varies for each month and more.
